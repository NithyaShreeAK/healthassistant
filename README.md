#  Multi-Disease Prediction System

A unified machine learning-based tool for the **early prediction of chronic diseases** — **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, **Parkinson’s Disease**, and **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** — using patient medical data.

---

##  Project Overview

Chronic illnesses like Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson's, and ASD impact millions globally. Early detection is crucial, yet many symptoms are subtle in the initial stages and often go undiagnosed. This project aims to streamline preliminary screening by offering a **single platform that predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases** from user input using trained ML models.

##  Features

-  Predicts 4 diseases using individual ML models
-  Integrated UI for user-friendly medical input
-  Instant predictions based on trained models
-  Reduces manual diagnostic errors
-  Useful for remote healthcare, general clinics, and health apps

 ##  Installation

 1. **Clone the repository**:
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-disease-predictor.git
 cd multi-disease-predictor


 Create a virtual environment:
 python3 -m venv venv
 source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux

 Install the required packages:
 pip install -r requirements.txt

 streamlit run app.py

 Datasets Used
 Public datasets relevant to each disease were used and preprocessed to train the ML models.

 Data sources include:

 Kaggle
 UCI Machine Learning Repository
 Other open medical data platforms


 Use Cases
 General clinics for rapid screening
 Telemedicine and remote diagnostics
